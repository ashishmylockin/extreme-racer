// AI tuning: think = frames between decisions, look = how far ahead it sees (px),
// miss = chance it fails to notice a given car, cooldown = min frames between lane changes,
// greedy = detours for coins when the road is clear, speed = the pace it likes to hold
// Vs CPU: late = how many frames before impact it finally spots a car it failed to notice and swerves (a last-second dodge, sometimes too late),
// push = how far above your speed it will go to get back in the fight, attack = how often its race plan is to take the lead
